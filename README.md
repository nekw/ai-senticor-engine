## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-senticor-engine.git
cd ai-senticor-engine

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run src/app.py

# Optional: Reload RAG database with fresh sample news
streamlit run src/app.py -- --reload-db
```

### � Privacy Configuration (Recommended)

To prevent Streamlit from sending usage statistics, create or edit the config file:

```bash
# Create the Streamlit config directory
mkdir -p ~/.streamlit  # On Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.streamlit

# Add the following to ~/.streamlit/config.toml
[browser]
gatherUsageStats = false
```

This disables telemetry and keeps your usage data private.

### �🔑 API Key Configuration

Some data providers require API keys. OpenBB Platform uses a centralized credential system.

**Environment Variables**
```bash
# Create a .env file in the project root
OBB_FMP_API_KEY=your_fmp_key_here
OBB_POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_key_here
OBB_BENZINGA_API_KEY=your_benzinga_key_here
OBB_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_av_key_here
```

**Provider-Specific Keys:**
- **FMP** (Financial Modeling Prep): [Get free key](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs)
- **Polygon.io**: [Get free key](https://polygon.io/)
- **Benzinga**: [Get key](https://www.benzinga.com/apis)
- **Alpha Vantage**: [Get free key](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)
- **Intrinio**: [Get key](https://intrinio.com/)

**Note**: Yahoo Finance (yfinance) does not require an API key.
